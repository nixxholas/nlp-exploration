### In a basic form of a language model, we can recognize the sentence through this process:
> P(|W| = 4, w1 = "hi", w2 = "this", w3 = "is", w4 = "Nicholas")

Where W is the language model.
**Note** -> w0 is a start tag to signalize the start of the sentence.
**Same goes for w5 as an end tag to signalize the end of the sentence.**

In this entire module, we will only be going through the simplest form of NLP, known as Part of Speech. A part of speech tagging NLP system will allow you to gain a basic understanding of how a language processing engine processes data.
