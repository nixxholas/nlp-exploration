## Creating a Part Of Speech Tagger

#### Objectives
- Store a set of predefined examples for tagging.
- Utilize a Part Of Speech Tagging If logic to tag words.
- Filter out words that are "noisy" for us.

In the Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging,
> Each training example consists of a sentence (the input) and the entire tag
sequence is the associated symbol (i.e. \NN).

> Thus, the function will take in a sentence and tags the input/s with
the tag sequence.

To simplify the process for creating a Part Of Speech tagger engine, we will segregate it into a few segments:
- Corpus (This is simply known as a dictionary)
